Creating an Issue
---

Use the Prepopulated Template that we provide.  Issues reported that do not use the template will be rejected.


Creating a Pull Request
---

Before you can submit a PR, you will need to:

1. Make a New Branch off of `staging` ( ideally you will name your branch for the issue you are fixing, e,g, `issue-3-fixing-logger` )
2. Commit & Push your New Branch, with a comment like `Fixes #3` to auto trigger a status change for that issue
3. Make your Pull Request into the `develop`
4. Set `Reviewers` and `Assignees` to `Peter Schmalfeldt` ( or other project administrator )
5. Choose an appropriate label from the `Labels`

Now you can submit a new PR using the Prepopulated Template that we provide.  PR's submitted that do not use the template will be rejected.
